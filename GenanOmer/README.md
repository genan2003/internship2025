Finishing Tour of Rust and Rustlings exercises.

## 1 July 2025

Doing most of the labs using a STM32. Recalling what I learned.

## 2 July 2025

Reading more about TockOS and technical details about the NXP-LPC55 board. Starting to work on a issue related to a NXP board really soon.

## 3 July 2025

Installing Tock, libtock-c, and libtock-rs, and starting to experiment with them (building a small app, flashing an STM32F429ZI with Tock), as well as reading more about the TockOS architecture.

## 4 July 2025

Reading about how to write the TockOS kernel and how to boot the NXP LPC55 board. Next week, I will start working on the issue alongside Vlad.

## 7 July 2025

Started working on the issue today. I began by learning how to open the debug probe on the board. Then I started looking into the memory mapping of the board and began writing the layout.ld file.

After creating the layout.ld file, Vlad identified the architecture for the Cortex-M33 and added it to Tock. Before that, we began writing the other required components (the chip file and the board file), but we ran into a problem.

After building the program and attempting to flash it to the board using probe-rs, we encountered an error related to the build file. Specifically, the sections are not being created properly on the chip, and the flashing process is failing.

We tried several solutions, but haven’t made any progress yet. We’ll look into it further tomorrow.

## 8 July 2025

Today we successfully booted the NXP-LPC55 board for the first time.

The issue preventing it from booting was due to a missing `build.rs` entry in the board's `Cargo.toml` manifest file. Once we added the missing entry, the board booted without any problems.

After confirming the boot process, we tested the board using semihosting to verify functionality. Everything worked as expected.

## 9 July 2025

Today I picked up a new task focused on working with GPIO for the NXP-LPC55 board.

I began by reviewing how GPIO is implemented on other boards and examining how the relevant registers are defined. To proceed, I searched for the `.svd` file for the LPC55 and successfully found it online.

However, I ran into an issue with the `svd2regs.py` script—it wasn’t working as expected. After several attempts to debug the problem, I decided to pause and revisit it with a fresh perspective tomorrow.

## 10 July 2025

Today I focused on resolving the issue with the `svd2regs.py` script. The solution was to roll back the `cmsis-svd` package to version `0.4`, which restored compatibility and allowed the script to run correctly.

With the script working, I successfully generated the GPIO register definitions from the board's `.svd` file. After that, I started implementing basic GPIO operations and began defining the board’s pins accordingly.

## 11 July 2025

Today, I spent time reading and deepening my understanding of how GPIO and IOCON work on the NXP-LPC55 board. I focused on grasping the configuration flow and how these components interact.

This helped me clarify the next steps needed for implementing GPIO functionality on the board.

## 14 July 2025

Today, I opened a pull request on the main Tock repository to address the issues with the svd2regs.py script.
My solution was to set up a uv package manager project, which ensures all dependencies are installed with the correct versions. This approach improves reproducibility and avoids version-related breakages in the future.
The pull request can be seen (here)[https://github.com/tock/tock/pull/4507].

## 15 July 2025

Today, I began implementing the IOCON register definitions along with methods to configure pin modes.

After completing the IOCON setup, I attempted to blink an LED on the board as a basic test. However, nothing happened, so I started investigating the issue. By the end of the day, I suspected the problem might be related to the `.elf` file’s entry point.

I plan to dive deeper into this and work on a fix tomorrow.

## 16 July 2025

Today, I resumed work on blinking the LED and investigated the suspected issue with the `.elf` file’s entry point. It turned out the real problem was that I had forgotten to initialize the stack memory, which prevented the program from flashing to the board. After fixing this, the LED blinked successfully—confirming that the basic setup is now functional.

Next, I moved on to implementing GPIO interrupts and attempted to test them using a button. I defined the necessary interrupt logic, but the button input did not trigger as expected. I plan to investigate the issue further tomorrow.

## 17 July 2025

Today, I began by learning more about interrupts and understanding the steps required to implement one. After that, I worked on developing the necessary functions to use interrupts effectively.

## 18 July 2025

I learned more about interrupts and discovered that NXP boards require additional peripherals to handle them. With this understanding, I plan to begin implementing interrupts next week.

## 21 July 2025

After identifying the necessary peripherals for implementing interrupts, I began working on integrating the `PINT` peripheral to enable interrupt functionality on my board. I encountered several errors during the process, so I decided to continue troubleshooting and development tomorrow.

## 22 July 2025

Today, I created a basic implementation of the `PINT` peripheral and began testing it. However, when I checked the `.elf` file, I noticed a critical issue—the `.vectors` section was missing. This raised some concerns, so I verified a sample application from the MCUXpresso IDE, where the `.vectors` section was present. I plan to investigate the cause of this discrepancy tomorrow.

## 23 July 2025

Today, I continued investigating the issue from yesterday, but despite trying several solutions, nothing worked. I even attempted to manually add the `.vectors` section in the `layout.ld` file, but it still didn’t appear. I’ve decided to continue exploring the problem tomorrow.

## 24 July 2025

Today, I resolved the issue I encountered yesterday. It turned out that something was missing from the `lib.rs` file, and I was able to identify the problem quickly. Additionally, the `.vectors` section was not correctly placed in memory, so I had to add an offset to align it properly, following the example for reference.

## 25 July 2025

Today, I read more about how the `PINT` peripheral works and what I have to make next week.

## 28 July 2025

Today, I ran into a major issue—when I uploaded the code to the board, it immediately triggered the `svc` interrupt, which is unexpected behavior. I spent time trying to identify the cause, but I wasn’t able to find a solution. I’ve decided to continue debugging the problem tomorrow.

## 29 July 2025

Today, I continued working on the issue and tried to pinpoint the root cause. I explored several possible solutions, but none of them worked. I’ve decided to dive deeper into the documentation to better understand what I might be doing wrong.

## 30 July 2025

Today, I resolved the issue with the `svc` interrupt. I began testing my interrupt functions, but they still didn’t work as expected—likely due to something I implemented incorrectly. To troubleshoot, I reviewed the interrupt implementation from Embassy and incorporated their approach into my code. I plan to test the changes tomorrow.

## 31 July 2025

Today was a big day—I finally got interrupts working! I tested them using an LED (since I haven’t implemented UART yet), and confirmed that the LED blinks correctly when an interrupt is triggered. It turns out the issue was caused by the `semihosting` dependency. With that resolved, I’ve now started working on implementing the drivers.
